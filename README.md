# Logisim74xx

[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) 7400 series integrated circuits library

## Goal

This library aims to be a comprehensive 7400 series library for Logisim for designing logical circuits and for educational purposes.

## Design Guidelines

To meet these goals, the following design guidelines are met:

* Circuits are build from standard gates only.
* The pin layout matches the DIP pinout of the corresponding chips.
* Automated tests are provided.

## Progress

See [Wiki](https://github.com/r0the/74xx/wiki) for a list of supported chips. Currently, circuits from other libraries are 
being integrated will later be redesigned to meet the guidelines.
